<p style="text-indent: 40px">I am having symptoms of depression at a higher frequency lately. This escalated when I lost my Financial Aid status. Earning degrees feels like a major part of my identity. I took out a Sallie Mae loan to cover this year's semester in case my appeal is denied. I also applied for a few other programs at Bryant & Stratton College (Bachelor of Business Administration program in Human Resources and Accounting Certificate Program in the event that I decide to stay at Buffalo State). My Mother has told me that my terminally ill Great Aunt is leaving me enough money in her Last Will and Testament, to allow me to apply for Niagara University's Master of Science in Information Security & Digital Forensics Program.</p><br><p style="text-indent: 40px">However, when I reflect on this it seems more rational to use the money prudently to pay off my current student loans or buy a house for my family. I could easily learn any subject at home, but I seem to be obsessed with accreditation rather than financial success. I understand it is my responsibility to work past my vanity, entitlement issues and reevaluate my priorities based on <u>rationality</u> immediately. </p><br><p style="text-indent: 40px">This brings me to conclusion that it would be best to find a career and become a responsible provider for my family. Alas, I can't seem to find a field that I am passionate about. If I don't enjoy what I'm doing for a living I have a propensity to become resentful, stressed and depressed. If I experience these negative emotional mental states frequently, I observe an innate proclivity to turn to psychoactive substances just to cope in an attempt to avoid a mental breakdown.</p>
